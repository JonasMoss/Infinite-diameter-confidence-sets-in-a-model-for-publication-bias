This paper is about a technical result concerning publication bias in meta-analysis. The mathematics used is elementary measure theory.

I believe it would be best to have a reviewer who knows meta-analysis, elementary measure theory, and foundational issues in statistics. I believe Peter Grünwald would be an excellent reviewer, as he has worked extensively with foundational issues, is a mathematical statistician, and knows meta-analysis too.

A fair review would also include an expert on publication bias itself. I believe the psychologist Marcel A.L.M. van Assen would be a good fit here. He is not a mathematician, but a quantitively minded psychologist.

One of the most important researchers in meta-analysis and publication bias is Jack L. Vevea, who has been instrumental in developing promoting the methods discussed in this paper.
